# Raspberry Pi plant automation
Here I am making a plant automation system with watering, light schedule etc, this is to be used with a Raspberry Pi as it can run the Python and is a light way of having a plant automation system.
It has a pump and light functionality.

 It should be possible to SHH, so as to remote access into the Raspberry Pi from another network and or location.

Feel free to use the code and modify it to serve the needs of your specific setup.
