# rasberrypi
Here I am making a plant automation system with watering, light schedule etc, this is to be used with a Rasberrypi as it can interprete the Python and is a light way of having a plant automation system.
It has a pump for water.
light schedule.
A SHH function, so as to remote access into the Python from another network and or location.

Feel free to use the code and modify it to serve the needs of your specific setup.
